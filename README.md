Android/ArcGIS SDK - Show Device Location on Map
===================

Simple, bare-bones code for adding a device location to an Android App using the ArcGIS Android SDK

So after spending WAY too much time looking for a simple tutorial to show how to add a device’s location 
to an Android App using the ArcGIS Android SDK, I decided to write one. This search caused me a lot of 
frustration and I imagine other new Android programmers have encountered the same thing. Use this simple 
example project to learn how to add a device’s location to an Android App.

EDIT: Code has been modified to to suit the new Sdk version. 10.2.2
